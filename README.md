This repository contains an example of a common error in Rust involving unsafe code and raw pointers.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code that modifies a vector through a raw pointer. The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates a safer approach to achieve the same result using more idiomatic Rust methods. This example highlights the importance of careful memory management and using safer alternatives to raw pointers when possible. It showcases a scenario where undefined behavior occurs due to the misuse of raw pointers.
